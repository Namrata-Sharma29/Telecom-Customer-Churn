# Telecom-Customer-Churn
This project explores telecom customer churn data to uncover key patterns, high-risk segments, and actionable strategies for retention. Using Python for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, we identified that month-to-month contracts, certain internet plans, and specific payment methods have significantly higher churn rates.
