# Telecom-Customer-Churn
This project explores telecom customer churn data to uncover key patterns, high-risk segments, and actionable strategies for retention. Using Python for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, we identified that month-to-month contracts, certain internet plans, and specific payment methods have significantly higher churn rates.

# Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to identify patterns, key drivers, and actionable strategies to reduce churn.
The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and business insights, culminating in a presentation with recommendations for improving customer retention.

# Dataset
The dataset used (Telco_Customer_Churn.csv) contains demographic, service, and account information about customers, along with churn labels.

# Analysis Steps
## Data Cleaning

i. Removed empty/unnecessary columns  
ii. Converted data types for numerical analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

i. Uncovered churn patterns and trends  
ii. Churn by contract type, internet type, and payment method  
iii. Relationship between churn and satisfaction score, revenue, and age

## Visualization

i. Created charts for each major churn driver  
ii. Highlighted relations and trends using bar charts, area chart, etc.

# Business Insights

i. Quantified churn percentages by service and payment type  
ii. Identified high-risk customer segments

# Recommendations

i. Targeted retention campaigns

iii. Payment method optimization

# Key Insights

i. Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rates  
ii. Certain internet plans and payment methods are more prone to churn  
iii. Customers with lower satisfaction scores and higher revenue contribute significantly to revenue loss when they churn
